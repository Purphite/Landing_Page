        <div class="">
        <ul class="crew">
            <li class="hero"><img class="heroes" src="songoku.webp" alt=""> Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become a stronger fighter.</li>
            <li class="hero"><img class="heroes" src="piccolo.webp" alt=""> According to Grand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part of the Dragon Clan, who were the original creators of the Dragon Balls. A wise and cunning warrior, he was the main antagonist in the final saga of Dragon Ball, the Piccolo Jr. Saga, and was thus a ruthless enemy of Goku.</li>
            <li class="hero"><img class="heroes" src="chiaotzu.png" alt=""> Chiaotzu is a white-skinned, red-cheeked little human who is the constant companion to Tien Shinhan, his best friend. Just like Krillin, Chiaotzu does not have a visible nose. He is first introduced near the end of the Fortuneteller Baba Saga in the anime.</li>
            <li class="hero"><img class="heroes" src="trunks.webp" alt=""> Future Trunks is a Saiyan-Earthling hybrid and the son of Vegeta and Bulma, both from an alternate future. By the time Present Trunks was born, the timeline had been drastically altered by Future Trunks' and Cell's trips to the past.</li>
            <li class="hero"><img class="heroes" src="vegeta.png" alt=""> Vegeta is the prince of an extraterrestrial warrior race known as the Saiyans. He is extremely arrogant, proud and hardworking; he often refers to his heritage and royal status throughout the series, but can also have a destructive temper.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section-3">
        <h2 class="qoute">“I'm not going to lie to you, Vegeta, although the answer may be difficult for you to hear. This is the truth. Goku devoted his life to protecting the lives of other. Because of his selflessness, when he died, he was allowed to keep his body and travel to King Kai's Planet. You, on the other hand, have spent your life in pursuit of your own selfish desires. You've caused too much pain. When you die, you will not receive the same reward.” - Piccolo</h2>
